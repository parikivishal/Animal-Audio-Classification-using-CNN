Animal Audio Classification using Deep Learning Model

This project aims to precict the animal name using the audio file using Convolutional Neural Networks and this contains a dataset with 5 classes and also contains proper validation so if we are uploading any other audio apart from these 5 classes then it will throw you as warning.

I was not able to upload the dataset since it was very huge in size
If you want the dataset feel free to reach out to pariki.vishal@outlook.com
